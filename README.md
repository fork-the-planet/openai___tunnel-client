# Tunnel Client

The tunnel client is an enterprise-hosted agent that connects your internal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to OpenAI-hosted products over a secure, outbound-only HTTPS channel.

## What it does (high level)

- The client **long-polls** the OpenAI tunnel control plane over HTTPS:
  - `GET /v1/tunnel/{tunnel_id}/poll`
  - `POST /v1/tunnel/{tunnel_id}/response`
- On startup, it fetches tunnel metadata for operator visibility:
  - `GET /v1/tunnels/{tunnel_id}`
- It forwards the received JSON-RPC requests to your configured MCP server over HTTP(S).
- It exposes an **admin/health server** (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`) for probes and Prometheus scraping.

## CLI

- `tunnel-client` shows help and available subcommands.
- `tunnel-client run` starts the client poller.
