description: Create, connect, list, and inspect MCP tunnels through the local tunnel-client plugin. Use when Codex needs to manage secure MCP tunnels with aliases and native tunnel-client runtime processes.

# Tunnel MCP

Use `scripts/tunnel_mcp` from this plugin when a user asks Codex to manage MCP
tunnels through `tunnel-client`. The plugin entrypoint is a thin router onto
the public native `tunnel-client sessions ...` and
`tunnel-client admin-profiles ...` command trees.

Preferred install surfaces:

- `tunnel-client codex plugin install` when the binary is available
- `tunnel-client codex plugin uninstall` when the installed plugin should be reset or removed
- `python3 plugins/tunnel-mcp/scripts/install_plugin.py` from a source checkout
- `python3 scripts/install_plugin.py` from an exported plugin bundle root

## Rules

- Use `tunnel-client admin tunnels` for remote tunnel CRUD. Do not call raw
  tunnel-service HTTP endpoints from this plugin.
- Route operational actions through the public native CLI:
  `tunnel-client sessions ...` and `tunnel-client admin-profiles ...`.
- Use native `tunnel-client run --profile <name>` for runtime processes. Do not
  use a helper shim that translates profile files into flags.
- Do not assume a specific source checkout, build system, internal helper, or
  tmux is available. The installed plugin must work with `tunnel-client` alone;
  Python is only needed for the standalone installer paths.
- Use tmux when available; otherwise start `tunnel-client run --profile <name>`
  as a detached background process and report the PID/log path.
- Tunnel state is owned by `tunnel-client`. By default it lives under
  `TUNNEL_CLIENT_STATE_DIR` or the platform state directory, and legacy
  `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex/tunnel-mcp` state is reused when it already exists.
- Admin CRUD configuration is owned by the native `admin-profiles` commands.
  Use `--admin-profile <name>` to select a profile and `--admin-key env:NAME`
  or `--admin-key file:/path` to store a non-default admin key reference. Do
  not pass literal admin keys.
- Preserve the link between tunnels and admin CRUD credentials by keeping
  `admin_profile` on alias and process records.
- Write generated runtime YAML to the native tunnel-client profile directory:
  `TUNNEL_CLIENT_PROFILE_DIR` when set, otherwise `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tunnel-client`,
  otherwise `~/.config/tunnel-client`. Keep `profile_name` and `profile_path` on
  alias and process records.
- Use `--runtime-api-key env:NAME` or `--runtime-api-key file:/path` when a
  runtime tunnel key should differ from the default `env:CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY`.
  Use `connect --tunnel-id <id>` to attach to a known existing tunnel without
  admin CRUD.
- Never write literal API keys, bearer tokens, cookies, or inline `sk-` style
  secret material into plugin state or generated configs.
- Treat stale local aliases as recoverable for `create` and `connect`. If a
  stored tunnel id no longer exists remotely, record `stale-alias` in history
  and continue with scoped remote lookup or creation.
- Treat stale local aliases as reportable for `status`. Do not silently create a
  replacement tunnel from `status`.

## Examples

```bash
scripts/tunnel_mcp create \
  --alias docs-mcp \
  --admin-profile default \
  --organization-id org_123
```

```bash
scripts/tunnel_mcp connect \
  --alias docs-mcp \
  --profile sample_mcp_with_dcr \
  --admin-profile default \
  --organization-id org_123 \
  --mcp-server-url http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp
```

```bash
scripts/tunnel_mcp connect \
  --alias docs-mcp \
  --tunnel-id tunnel_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef \
  --runtime-api-key env:TUNNEL_RUNTIME_KEY \
  --mcp-command "python /path/to/server.py"
```

```bash
scripts/tunnel_mcp status docs-mcp
```
